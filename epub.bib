               vocational education and training written by international
               experts The Wiley Handbook of Vocational Education and Training
               offers an in-depth guide to the theories, practices, and policies
               of vocational education and training (VET). With contributions
               from a panel of leading international scholars, the Handbook
               contains 27 authoritative essays from a wide range of
               disciplines. The contributors present an integrated analysis of
               the complex and dynamic field of VET. Drawing on the most recent
               research, thinking, and practice in the field, the book explores
               the key debates about the role of VET in the education and
               training systems of various nations. The Handbook reveals how
               expertise is developed in an age of considerable transformation
               in work processes, work organization, and occupational
               identities. The authors also examine many of the challenges of
               vocational education and training such as the impact of digital
               technologies on employment, the demand for (re)training in the
               context of extended working lives, the emergence of learning
               regions and skill ecosystems, and the professional development of
               vocational teachers and trainers. This important text: Offers an
               original view of VET’s role in both the initial and continuing
               development of expertise Examines the theories and concepts that
               underpin international perspectives and explores the differences
               about the purposes of VET Presents various models of learning
               used in VET, including apprenticeship, and their relationship
               with general education Explores how VET is shaped in different
               ways by the political economy of different countries Reviews how
               developments in digital technologies are changing VET practice
               Discusses the challenges for universities offering higher
               vocational education programs Draws on both recent research as

                 is a course of learning across different school- and work-based
                 practices. This chapter discusses such learning in terms of
                 boundary crossing between these practices. We conceptualize
                 boundaries as sociocultural differences that lead to
                 discontinuity in action or interaction. Such discontinuities
                 between school and work practices have frequently been reported
                 as problematic. Boundary crossing is defined as the efforts by
                 individuals or groups to establish or restore continuity in
                 relation to action or interaction across practices. As this
                 chapter argues, these efforts point to the learning potential
                 of boundary crossing between school and work practices, which
                 we summarize in terms of four learning mechanisms:
                 identification, coordination, perspective making and taking (or
                 mutual reflection), and transformation. These learning
                 mechanisms are discussed through illustrations from vocational
                 education and training. The chapter concludes by speculating on
                 what would be fruitful boundary analyses of situations where a
                 vocational curriculum could be improved.",

                 as the ability of vocational education and training (VET) to

                 curriculum design in terms of content and pedagogical approach.

                 increasingly shaped by institutional factors, which Dewey
                 (1916) refers to as the ?social side.? They extend to the
                 provision of detailed national prespecified outcomes, course
                 content, forms of assessment, and so on. Yet, the efficacy and
                 continuity of these educational provisions arise in response to
                 how individuals engage, learn, and remake them?what Dewey

                 examines the strength and nature of the relationship between
                 education, training, and occupation. It reviews key historical
                 aspects of socioeconomic and institutional change that underpin
                 debates about the concept of occupation and its changing
                 relationship with apprenticeship. The discussion draws on two
                 contrasting examples to illustrate how different concepts of
                 occupation affect the nature and quality of the associated
                 apprenticeships. The chapter argues that in the context of mass

                 learning (including apprenticeships) and the qualifications
                 associated with them need to generate hybrid benefits, through

                 and development and industrial relations. As the skills agenda
                 has moved to the forefront of public conversation, in a
                 practical sense training and development have become more of an
                 industrial relations concern, as policymakers exhort the social
                 actors to cooperate and build new partnership relations around
                 skills, training, and learning to help address the challenges
                 of building more productive economies. The chapter considers
                 the conceptual underpinnings of the industrial relations of
                 training, before reviewing developments in the British training
                 system, notably in terms of trade union?led learning
                 initiatives, within a more comparative context. The analysis
                 suggests that the industrial relations of training are heavily
                 influenced by the institutional structures and legacies that
                 help to regulate potential conflicts of interest around
                 training and development. However, ?mutual gains? are

               seek to leverage industry 4.0 principles for the digitalization
               and industrialization of construction. In addition to new
               technologies, these firms also bring new business models that
               depart from the project-based tendering system found in
               traditional construction. The first new business model is
               vertical integration. These firms are structured as integrated
               hierarchical firms, keeping control of product architecture and
               processes in-house. These firms control production by developing
               their own off-site factories. The second new business model is
               digital systems integration. These firms leverage an integrated
               cloud-based product configurator to enable mass customization.
               Using principles of capital-light industry 4.0 supply chains,
               digital system integrators can manufacture parts from periphery
               supply chain partners suppliers, including new sectors such as
               automotive, aerospace, manufacturing or industrial. The third new
               business model is the transformation of an existing project-based
               business toward industrialized construction through the creation
               of a spinoff factories. The chapter includes examples of the
               three business models and concludes with a discussion of how new

              increasingly integrated with artificial intelligence techniques in
              order to develop more personalized educational systems. These
              systems are known as Intelligent Tutoring systems (ITSs). This
              paper focused on the variant characteristics of ITSs developed
              across different educational fields. The original studies from
              2007 to 2017 were extracted from the PubMed, ProQuest, Scopus,
              Google scholar, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases.
              Finally, 53 papers were included in the study based on inclusion
              criteria. The educational fields in the ITSs were mainly computer
              sciences (37.73\%). Action-condition rule-based reasoning, data
              mining, and Bayesian network with 33.96\%, 22.64\%, and 20.75\%
              frequency respectively, were the most frequent artificial
              intelligent techniques applied in the ITSs. These techniques
              enable ITSs to deliver adaptive guidance and instruction, evaluate
              learners, define and update the learner’s model, and classify or
              cluster learners. Specifically, the performance of the system,
              learner’s performance, and experiences were used for evaluation of
              ITSs. Most ITSs were designed for web user interfaces. Although
              these systems could facilitate reasoning in the learning process,
              these systems have rarely been applied in experimental courses
              including problem-solving, decision-making in physics, chemistry,
              and clinical fields. Due to the important role of a cell phone in
              facilitating personalized learning and given the low rate of using
              mobile-based ITSs, this study has recommended the development and
              evaluation of mobile-based ITSs.",

              study was to analyze the different learning processes undertaken
              by novices and experts. Twenty semi-structured interviews were
              conducted with novice and expert nurses for the purpose of
              analyzing and comparing how their learning developed in clinical
              practice. Results indicated that novice learning is contingent on
              concept formation and assimilation. Novice learning is also framed
              by the feelings novices experience in the context of practice.
              Expert learning, on the other hand, was identified as a
              constructivist process using active concept integration and
              self-initiated strategies. Additionally, novices and experts
              identified different organizational factors that facilitated or
              hindered their learning. Experts were able to articulate systemic
              issues that affected their learning, whereas novices identified
              disparate individual issues. Implications for research and
              practice of continuing professional education are examined.",

               a powerful attack on the intellectual origins of totalitarianism.
               An immediate sensation when it was first published, Karl Popper’s
               monumental achievement has attained legendary status on both the
               Left and Right. Tracing the roots of an authoritarian tradition

              ``Participatory Qualitative Research.'' In recent years there has
              been a resurgence of interest in participatory research
              strategies. The articles in this special issue come from different
              disciplines. Against the background of concrete empirical research
              projects, they address numerous conceptual considerations and
              methodological approaches. After reading the contributions, and
              engaging with the authors' arguments, we were prompted to focus in
              particular on those areas in which further work needs to be done.
              They include, on the one hand, fundamental principles of
              participatory research, such as democratic-theory considerations,
              the concept of ``safe space,'' participation issues, and ethical
              questions. And, on the other hand, we focus on practical research
              considerations regarding the role and tasks of the various
              participants; specific methodological approaches; and quality
              criteria—understood here in the sense of arguments justifying a
              participatory approach. Our aim is to stimulate a broad discussion
              that does not focus only on participatory research in the narrower
              sense. Because participatory methodology poses certain knowledge-
              and research-related questions in a radical way, it has the

               presents a rigorously researched but counterintuitive model of
               how everyday market activity gets produced.If you’re convinced
               you know what a market is, think again. In his long-awaited
               study, French sociologist and engineer Michel Callon takes us to
               the heart of markets, to the unsung processes that allow
               innovations to become robust products and services. Markets in
               the Making begins with the observation that stable commercial
               transactions are more enigmatic, more elusive, and more involved
               than previously described by economic theory. Slicing through
               blunt theories of supply and demand, Callon presents a rigorously
               researched but counterintuitive model of market activity that
               emphasizes what people designing products or launching startups
               soon discover—the inherent difficulties of connecting individuals
               to things. Callon’s model is founded upon the notion of
               “singularization,” the premise that goods and services must adapt
               and be adapted to the local milieu of every individual whose life
               they enter. Person by person, thing by thing, Callon demonstrates
               that for ordinary economic transactions to emerge en masse,
               singular connections must be made.Pushing us to see markets as
               more than abstract interfaces where pools of anonymous buyers and
               sellers meet, Callon draws our attention to the exhaustively
               creative practices that market professionals continuously devise
               to entangle people and things. Markets in the Making exemplifies
               how prototypes, fragile curiosities that have only just been
               imagined, are gradually honed into predictable objects and
               practices. Once these are active enough to create a desired
               effect, yet passive enough to be transferred from one place to
               another without disruption, they will have successfully achieved
               the status of “goods” or “services.” The output of this more
               ample process of innovation, as redefined by Callon, is what we
               recognize as “the market”—commercial activity, at scale.The
               capstone of an influential research career at the forefront of
               science and technology studies, Markets in the Making coherently
               integrates the empirical perspective of product engineering with
               the values of the social sciences. After masterfully redescribing
               how markets are made, Callon culminates with a strong empirical
               argument for why markets can and should be harnessed to enact
               social change. His is a theory of markets that serves social
               critique.",

  abstract  = "How the history of technological revolutions can help us better
               understand economic and political polarization in the age of
               automation From the Industrial Revolution to the age of
               artificial intelligence, The Technology Trap takes a sweeping
               look at the history of technological progress and how it has
               radically shifted the distribution of economic and political
               power among society's members. As Carl Benedikt Frey shows, the
               Industrial Revolution created unprecedented wealth and prosperity
               over the long run, but the immediate consequences of
               mechanization were devastating for large swaths of the
               population. Middle-income jobs withered, wages stagnated, the
               labor share of income fell, profits surged, and economic
               inequality skyrocketed. These trends, Frey documents, broadly
               mirror those in our current age of automation, which began with
               the Computer Revolution. Just as the Industrial Revolution
               eventually brought about extraordinary benefits for society,
               artificial intelligence systems have the potential to do the
               same. But Frey argues that this depends on how the short term is
               managed. In the nineteenth century, workers violently expressed
               their concerns over machines taking their jobs. The Luddite
               uprisings joined a long wave of machinery riots that swept across
               Europe and China. Today's despairing middle class has not
               resorted to physical force, but their frustration has led to
               rising populism and the increasing fragmentation of society. As
               middle-class jobs continue to come under pressure, there's no
               assurance that positive attitudes to technology will persist. The
               Industrial Revolution was a defining moment in history, but few
               grasped its enormous consequences at the time. The Technology
               Trap demonstrates that in the midst of another technological
               revolution, the lessons of the past can help us to more
               effectively face the present.",

  abstract  = "The great Russian psychologist L. S. Vygotsky has long been
               recognized as a pioneer in developmental psychology. But somewhat
               ironically, his theory of development has never been well
               understood in the West. Mind in Society should correct much of
               this misunderstanding. Carefully edited by a group of outstanding
               Vygotsky scholars, the book presents a unique selection of
               Vygotsky’s important essays, most of which have previously been
               unavailable in English.The Vygotsky who emerges from these pages
               can no longer be glibly included among the neobehaviorists. In
               these essays he outlines a dialectical-materialist theory of
               cognitive development that anticipates much recent work in
               American social science. The mind, Vygotsky argues, cannot be
               understood in isolation from the surrounding society. Man is the
               only animal who uses tools to alter his own inner world as well
               as the world around him. From the handkerchief knotted as a
               simple mnemonic device to the complexities of symbolic language,
               society provides the individual with technology that can be used
               to shape the private processes of mind. In Mind in Society
               Vygotsky applies this theoretical framework to the development of
               perception, attention, memory, language, and play, and he
               examines its implications for education. The result is a
               remarkably interesting book that is bound to renew Vygotsky’s
               relevance to modern psychological thought.",

               However, there is limited research on the impact of mobile MR
               (MMR) within construction education and improvement of the
               learners’ experience. With new building information modelling
               (BIM) workflows being adopted within the architecture,
               engineering and construction industry, innovative MMR pedagogical
               delivery methods should be explored to enhance this
               information-rich spatial technology workflow. This paper outlines
               qualitative results derived through thematic analysis of learner
               reflections from two technology-enhanced lessons involving a
               lecture and a hands-on workshop focussed on MMR-BIM delivered
               within postgraduate construction education. Seventy participants
               across the two lessons recruited from an Australian university
               participated to answer the research question: ‘Does applied
               mobile mixed reality create an enhanced learning environment for
               students?’ The results of the analysis suggest that using MMR-BIM
               can result in an enhanced learning environment that facilitates
               unique learning experiences, engagement and motivation. However,
               the study outcome suggests that to understand the processes
               leading to these learning aspects, further empirical research on

                 educational psychology. In this paper, six models of SRL are
                 analyzed and compared; that is, Zimmerman; Boekaerts; Winne and
                 Hadwin; Pintrich; Efklides; and Hadwin, Järvelä and Miller.
                 First, each model is explored in detail in the following
                 aspects: (a) history and development, (b) description of the
                 model (including the model figures), (c) empirical support, and
                 (d) instruments constructed based on the model. Then, the
                 models are compared in a number of aspects: (a) citations, (b)
                 phases and subprocesses, (c) how they conceptualize
                 (meta)cognition, motivation and emotion, (d)
                 top-down/bottom-up, (e) automaticity, and (f) context. In the
                 discussion, the empirical evidence from the existing SRL
                 meta-analyses is examined and implications for education are
                 extracted. Further, four future lines of research are proposed.
                 The review reaches two main conclusions. First, the SRL models
                 form an integrative and coherent framework from which to
                 conduct research and on which students can be taught to be more
                 strategic and successful. Second, based on the available
                 meta-analytic evidence, there are differential effects of SRL
                 models in light of differences in students' developmental
                 stages or educational levels. Thus, scholars and teachers need
                 to start applying these differential effects of the SRL models
                 and theories to enhance students' learning and SRL skills.",

               way of improving organizational performance, the debate about the
               learning organization has grown. Counterbalancing the often
               over-optimistic assumptions made about the future of work and
               learning, this book argues that without a contextualized analysis
               of the field, our understanding of the learning environment is
               limited. It reconsiders the true role and nature of workplace
               learning in context. Grounded in original research, the book
               features case studies which illuminate how the workplace
               environment can provide both barriers to and opportunities for
               learning. It explores learning in different organizational
               contexts and different countries, sectors, types of public and
               private sector organization, and by different occupational
               groups. This multi-disciplinary approach provides a coherent
               perspective of the institutional, organizational and pedagogical
               contexts of workplace learning, and as a result, policy-makers,
               trainers, trade unionists and educators alike will welcome this
               groundbreaking text, as it gives the intellectual tools required

               learning that are often dichotomized: formal and informal, theory
               and practice. Indeed one of the central challenges facing all
               those involved in developing understandings of workplace learning
               is that of conceptualizing how these aspects of learning actually
               come together within the experience of the learners. This chapter
               outlines key aspects of our research into the accountancy

               re-engineering of the learning experience within accountancy,

               ‘disciplinary ways of being’ at the heart of modern learning, is
               fundamental to understandings of learning and also to the process

               low-wage workers, both employed and unemployed, effected through
               the widespread use of ‘basic skills’ assessments. Employers are
               increasingly using literacy, numeracy and language skills
               assessments as the basis of hiring decisions as well as a range
               of other employment decisions, including promotion, assignment or
               reassignment, and firing. Assessment is used in ‘workplace basic
               skills’ programmes, both in the ‘needs assessment’ phase prior to
               the establishment of programmes and in the post-programmes
               ‘learning assessment’ phase. In the workplace, the unequal nature
               of the employment relationship and the requirement for programmes
               of education or training to have a measurable impact on
               profitability tend to conflict with the need for the
               dispassionate and unthreatening assessment required in programmes
               of fundamental education. This tendency has been magnified in the
               recent past as performance on literacy, numeracy and language
               proficiency assessments has been interpreted as a consummate
               indicator of ‘fitness’ for work. The chapter concludes that the
               use of ‘basic skills’ assessments represents an area of
               fundamental conflict between capital and labour and that, in
               cases where training programmes are designed to remediate basic
               skills ‘deficiencies’, the quality of the training itself is
               frequently as problematic as the assessment.",

               and support for learning are directed towards its continuity and
               in ways often inherently pedagogical. Individuals, likewise,
               engage and learn in workplaces as directed by their personal
               goals and directions. Core tensions in this relationship are
               between these two sets of continuities. A critique of the current

               Case-study evidence is used to illuminate the relationship
               between work and learning in relation to three participatory
               dimensions: (1) opportunities for engaging in multiple (and
               overlapping) communities of practice at and beyond the workplace;
               (2) access to a multidimensional approach to the acquisition of
               expertise through the organization of work and job design; and
               (3) the opportunity to pursue knowledge-based courses and

               environments’ and practise an expansive approach to learning,

               cultures of higher education and the workplace, contrasting the
               kinds of knowledge that are valued and the manner in which they
               are acquired and used. In particular, performance in the
               workplace typically involves the integration of several different
               forms of knowledge and skill, under conditions that allow little
               time for the analytic/deliberative approach favoured in higher
               education. One consequence is greater reliance on tacit
               knowledge, including knowledge of how more formal, explicit
               knowledge is used in various practice settings. The second half
               focuses on transfer as a learning process, which requires both
               understanding and positive commitment from individual learners,
               formal education, employers and local workplace managers.
               Transfer is conceptualized in terms of five stages, whose
               distinctive characteristics and learning challenges are discussed
               in some detail. The neglect of transfer is attributed both to the
               cultural gap between formal education and the workplace and
               profound ignorance of the nature and amount of the learning
               involved.",

               in the workplace as elsewhere, for example by measuring the
               attainments of such learning. Drawing upon empirical data, we
               argue that this is counter-productive. Workplace learning is
               complex, yet a research focus on measured attainments implicitly
               defines such learning in a narrow way, within an acquisition
               perspective. This severely restricts the range of learning that
               can be recognized. Ironically, the very types of learning likely
               to be excluded are some of the most common and significant. To
               gain a better understanding of workplace learning and to
               effectively improve it, we need to resist scientific
               reductionism, and work with more holistic theoretical and

               papers has been to understand workplace learning and the ways in
               which it can be enhanced. By drawing on leading edge research
               from a number of countries and different disciplinary
               backgrounds, this book provides a synthesis of theory and
               empirical research. A key theme running through all the chapters
               is that learning that takes place in the workplace is highly
               contextualized. This requires a focus on the learner, the process
               of learning and a range of sources of learning other than
               structured and intentional interventions by teachers and
               trainers. Nevertheless, this focus on learning rather than
               teaching does not mean a focus on the learner as an individual.
               Individuals learn through their membership of social groups and
               the workplace is par excellence a site for participating in the
               social relations of production. The context of learning can be
               conceptualized at a number of different levels, requiring an
               understanding of societal, institutional and organizational
               structures, as well as the social relations of work groups and
               ‘communities of practice’ external to the workplace.",

               productivity. Investing in their (or one’s own development) is
               assumed to result in economic dividends. As Garrick argues, ‘The

               then [the emergence of human capital theory], fuelled a very

  abstract  = "Architects have been intrigued by prefabricated construction
               since the early twentieth century. Recent advances in design,
               engineering and manufacturing processes have led to a significant
               expansion in the use of pre-assembled components, which are
               fitted to finished structures on site. Collectively, such
               processes are becoming known as *offsite construction*. A
               ground-breaking text, Offsite Architecture establishes the
               current – and future – state of thinking in this field. A range
               of the most highly regarded thinkers and practitioners from
               around the globe share their ideas and practical findings on
               offsite prefabrication, examining theory and practice,
               opportunities and challenges, successes and failures. A timely
               response to the growing interest in this method, the book
               provides the fundamental basis for a critical, reflective
               approach to offsite architecture. Contributions from both
               academics and professionals make Offsite Architecture required
               reading for practitioners as well as students taking courses in
               architecture, prefabrication, construction and engineering.",

               potential to unleash and introduce dynamics and tension in

               engender a new industrial conception of architecture. Off-site

               combines the promise of industrialised building with the dream of
               a popular mass market for architecture, and it has exercised a
               magnetism over architectural culture which is as strong today as
               it was at any point in the past. The interest originated in the
               mid-nineteenth century, but achieved a strong uptake in the early
               to mid-twentieth century, and has continued in a cyclical pattern

               with the prefab house and discusses some of the complications

               efficient procurement processes, the convenience of recycling

               conveniently reuse some ‘waste’ material in the next project

               materials and products as needed for one building at a time, and

               Ratey literally 'wrote the book' on ADD/ADHD more than two
               decades ago. Their bestseller, Driven to Distraction, largely
               introduced this diagnosis to the public and sold more than a
               million copies along the way. Now, most people have heard of ADHD
               and know someone who may have it. But lost in the discussion of
               both childhood and adult diagnosis of ADHD is the potential
               upside: many hugely successful entrepreneurs and highly creative
               people attribute their achievements to ADHD. Also unknown to most
               are the recent research developments, including innovations that
               give a clearer understanding of the ADHD brain in action. In ADHD
               2.0, Drs Hallowell and Ratey, both of whom have this 'variable
               attention trait', draw on the latest science to provide both
               parents and adults with ADHD a plan for minimizing the downside
               and maximizing the benefits of ADHD at any age. They offer an
               arsenal of new strategies and lifestyle hacks for thriving with
               ADHD, including: - Find the right kind of difficult. Use these
               behaviour assessments to discover the work, activity, or creative
               outlet best suited to an individual's unique strengths. -
               Reimagine environment. What specific elements to look for - at
               home, at school, or in the workplace - to enhance the creativity
               and entrepreneurial spirit inherent in the ADHD mind. - Embrace
               innate neurological tendencies. Take advantage of new findings
               about the brain's default mode network and cerebellum, which
               confer major benefits for people with ADHD. - Tap into the
               healing power of connection. Tips for establishing and
               maintaining positive connection, 'the other Vitamind C', and the

               and a leading writer of speculative fiction join forces to answer
               an imperative question: How will artificial intelligence change

               of the twenty-first century. Within two decades, aspects of daily
               human life will be unrecognizable. AI will generate unprecedented
               wealth, revolutionize medicine and education through
               human-machine symbiosis, and create brand new forms of
               communication and entertainment. In liberating us from routine
               work, however, AI will also challenge the organizing principles

               risks in the form of autonomous weapons and smart technology that
               inherits human bias. AI is at a tipping point, and people need to
               wake up-both to AI's radiant pathways and its existential perils

               that the path to success is quantifying human performance,
               publicizing the results, and dividing up the rewards based on the
               numbers. But in our zeal to instill the evaluation process with
               scientific rigor, we've gone from measuring performance to
               fixating on measuring itself—and this tyranny of metrics now
               threatens the quality of our organizations and lives. In this
               brief, accessible, and powerful book, Jerry Muller uncovers the
               damage metrics are causing and shows how we can begin to fix the
               problem. Filled with examples from business, medicine, education,

               measured performance doesn't work, why surgical scorecards may
               increase deaths, and much more. But Muller also shows that, when
               used as a complement to judgment based on personal experience,
               metrics can be beneficial, and he includes an invaluable
               checklist of when and how to use them. The result is an essential

               workplace?Drawing on research of a wide variety of workplaces in
               different countries, Stephen Billett analyses the strengths and
               limitations of 'on-the-job' learning. He outlines what knowledge
               individuals need and how they can best acquire this knowledge in
               workplace settings. He shows how to develop a workplace
               curriculum, and how it can be implemented in organisations of
               different sizes. Learning in the Workplace offers a comprehensive
               pedagogy for the workplace. It is a valuable reference for human
               resource practitioners and students in courses on professional
               development and adult and vocational learning.",

               Disruptive technologies have increased speculation about what it
               means to be an architect. Innovations simultaneously offer great
               promise and potential risk to design practice. This volume
               identifies the game-changing trends driven by technology, and the
               opportunities they provide for architecture, urbanism and design.
               It advocates for an approach of intelligent control that
               transforms practice with specialist knowledge of technological
               models and systems. It features new developments in automation,
               generative design, augmented reality, videogame urbanism,
               artificial intelligence and robotics, as well as lived
               experiences within a continually shifting landscape. Showcasing
               evolving research, it discusses the cultural, social,
               environmental and political implications of various technological
               trajectories. In doing so it speculates upon future urban,
               spatial, aesthetic and formal possibilities within architecture.

               a less miserable, more productive place.'' Every organization is
               plagued by destructive friction. Yet some forms of friction are
               incredibly useful, and leaders who attempt to improve workplace
               efficiency often make things even worse. Drawing from seven years
               of hands-on research, The Friction Project by bestselling authors
               Robert I. Sutton and Huggy Rao teaches readers how to become
               ``friction fixers.'' Sutton and Rao kick off the book by
               unpacking how skilled friction fixers think and act like trustees
               of others' time. They provide friction forensics to help readers
               identify where to avert and repair bad organizational friction
               and where to maintain and inject good friction. Then their help
               pyramid shows how friction fixers do their work, from reframing
               friction troubles they can't fix right now, so they feel less

               of the book digs into the causes and solutions for five of the

               addition sickness, broken connections, jargon monoxide, and fast
               and frenzied people and teams. Sound familiar? Sutton and Rao are
               here to help. They wrap things up with lessons for leading your

               things; the power of civility, caring, and love for propelling
               designs and repairs; and embracing the mess that is an inevitable
               part of the process (while still trying to clean it up).",

               should be Delivered from Distraction.' Michael Thompson, Ph.D.,
               New York Times bestselling co-author of Raising Cain In 1994,
               Driven to Distraction sparked a revolution in our understanding
               of attention deficit disorder. Widely recognized as the classic
               in the field, the book has sold more than a million copies. Now a
               second revolution is under way in the approach to ADD, and the
               news is great. Drug therapies, our understanding of the role of
               diet and exercise, even the way we define the disorder - all are
               changing radically. And doctors are realizing that millions of
               adults suffer from this condition, though the vast majority of
               them remain undiagnosed and untreated. In this new book, Drs
               Edward M. Hallowell and John J. Ratey build on the breakthroughs
               of Driven to Distraction to offer a comprehensive and entirely
               up-to-date guide to living a successful life with ADD. As
               Hallowell and Ratey point out, 'attention deficit disorder' is a
               highly misleading description of an intriguing kind of mind.
               Original, charismatic, energetic, often brilliant, people with
               ADD have extraordinary talents and gifts embedded in their highly
               charged but easily distracted minds. Tailored expressly to ADD
               learning styles and attention spans, Delivered from Distraction
               provides accessible, engaging discussions of every aspect of the
               condition, from diagnosis to finding the proper treatment regime.
               Inside you'll discover: - whether ADD runs in families - new
               diagnostic procedures, tests, and evaluations - the links between
               ADD and other conditions - how people with ADD can free up their
               inner talents and strengths - the new drugs and how they work,
               and why they're not for everyone - exciting advances in
               nonpharmaceutical therapies, including changes in diet, exercise,
               and lifestyle - how to adapt the classic twelve-step program to
               treat ADD - sexual problems associated with ADD and how to
               resolve them - strategies for dealing with procrastination,
               clutter, and chronic forgetfulness ADD is a trait, a way of
               living in the world. It only becomes a disorder when it impairs
               your life. Featuring gripping profiles of patients with ADD who
               have triumphed, Delivered from Distraction is a wise, loving
               guide to releasing the positive energy that all people with ADD

               sentence--a mathematically consistent algorithm incapable of

               What if you want to buy a driverless car and must choose between
               one programmed to save as many lives as possible and another that
               prioritizes the lives of its own passengers? And would you agree
               to share your family's full medical history if you were told that
               it would help researchers find a cure for cancer?These are just
               some of the dilemmas that we are beginning to face as we approach
               the age of the algorithm, when it feels as if the machines reign
               supreme. Already, these lines of code are telling us what to
               watch, where to go, whom to date, and even whom to send to jail.
               But as we rely on algorithms to automate big, important
               decisions--in crime, justice, healthcare, transportation, and
               money--they raise questions about what we want our world to look

               preserving privacy? Protecting victims of crime or preventing
               innocent people being falsely accused? Hello World takes us on a
               tour through the good, the bad, and the downright ugly of the
               algorithms that surround us on a daily basis. Mathematician
               Hannah Fry reveals their inner workings, showing us how

               in which human bias can literally be written into the code. By
               weaving in relatable, real world stories with accessible
               explanations of the underlying mathematics that power algorithms,
               Hello World helps us to determine their power, expose their

               of power between capital and labour and how the new social

               algorithms used by computers can also untangle very human

               limits that give rise to a particular set of problems. What
               should we do, or leave undone, in a day or a lifetime? How much

               better hunches and when to leave things to chance, how to deal
               with overwhelming choices and how best to connect with others.
               From finding a spouse to finding a parking spot, from organizing

              teaching is not treated as a design profession. Every day,
              teachers design and test new ways of teaching, using learning

               new interpretation of why technology has all too often benefited
               elites - and how we must reshape the path of innovation to create
               true shared prosperity.A thousand years of history and
               contemporary evidence make one thing clear. Progress is not
               automatic but depends on the choices we make about technology.
               New ways of organizing production and communication can either
               serve the narrow interests of an elite or become the foundation
               for widespread prosperity.Much of the wealth generated by
               agricultural advances during the European Middle Ages was
               captured by the Church and used to build grand cathedrals while
               the peasants starved. The first hundred years of
               industrialization in England delivered stagnant incomes for
               workers, while making a few people very rich. And throughout the
               world today, digital technologies and artificial intelligence
               increase inequality and undermine democracy through excessive
               automation, massive data collection, and intrusive
               surveillance.It doesn't have to be this way. Power and Progress
               demonstrates that the path of technology was once - and can again
               be - brought under control. The tremendous computing advances of
               the last half century can become empowering and democratizing
               tools, but not if all major decisions remain in the hands of a
               few hubristic tech leaders striving to build a society that
               elevates their own power and prestige.With their breakthrough
               economic theory and manifesto for a better society, Acemoglu and
               Johnson provide the understanding and the vision to reshape how
               we innovate and who really gains from technological advances so
               we can create real prosperity for all.",

               difference is made by people. This means that recruiting,
               engaging and retaining the very best talent has never been more
               important.Crucially, these employees should be a diverse group of
               people with different approaches, skills and strengths in
               problem-solving and driving innovation. As well as focusing on
               gender, race, age and class, it is critical that businesses also

               outperforming the competition and achieving sustainable business
               growth.Neurodiversity at Work is a practical guide that explains
               what neurodiversity is, why it's important and what the benefits
               are. It covers how to attract, recruit and engage neurodiverse
               talent and provides guidance on how to adapt HR policies,
               processes and workplaces to ensure that all employees, including
               the 2 in 10 employees in the UK who are neurodiverse, can reach
               their full potential. Neurodiversity at Work is packed full of
               case studies from leading organizations like Microsoft who are
               already seeing the productivity, performance and financial
               benefits of neurodiversity in the workplace. Individuals in these

               research from the United States, Europe and Australia, this

               architecture and planning representative of the wider paradigms

               Johnson's ``Where Good Ideas Come From: The Seven Patterns of
               Innovation'' identifies key principles that are the driving force
               of creativity. Learn how: a slow hunch can be much more valuable
               than a Eureka moment; the connected 'hive mind' is smarter than
               the lone thinker; where you think matters just as much as what
               you're thinking; and, the best ideas come from building on the
               ideas and inventions of others. From the Renaissance to
               satellites, medical breakthroughs to social media, Charles Darwin
               to Marconi, Steven Johnson shows how, by recognising where and
               how patterns of creativity occur, we can all discover the secrets

               reach their potential for learning effectiveness and efficiency.

               conditions under which those guidelines are most effective. This

               number of diagnosis categories listed by the American Psychiatric

               Derek Thompson puts pop culture under the lens of science to
               answer the question that every business, every producer, every
               person looking to promote themselves and their work has asked.
               Drawing on ancient history and modern headlines - from vampire
               lore and Brahms's Lullaby to Instagram - Thompson explores the
               economics and psychology of why certain things become
               extraordinarily popular. With incisive analysis and captivating
               storytelling, he reveals that, though blockbuster films, Internet
               memes and number-one songs seem to have come out of nowhere, hits
               actually have a story and operate by certain rules. People
               gravitate towards familiar surprises: products that are bold and
               innovative, yet instantly comprehensible. Whether he is
               uncovering the secrets of JFK and Barack Obama's speechwriters or
               analysing the unexpected reasons for the success of Fifty Shades
               of Grey, Thompson goes beyond the cultural phenomena that make
               the news by revealing the desires that make us all human. While
               technology might change, he shows, our innate preferences do not,
               and throughout history hits have held up a mirror to ourselves.

               from small-scale Etsy entrepreneurs to the origin of Star Wars,

               introduces the people and systems that will replace them. In an
               internet-enhanced society, according to Richard Susskind and
               Daniel Susskind, we will neither need nor want doctors, teachers,
               accountants, architects, the clergy, consultants, lawyers, and
               many others, to work as they did in the 20th century. The Future
               of the Professions explains how increasingly capable technologies
               - from telepresence to artificial intelligence - will place the
               'practical expertise' of the finest specialists at the fingertips
               of everyone, often at no or low cost and without face-to-face
               interaction. The authors challenge the 'grand bargain' - the
               arrangement that grants various monopolies to today's
               professionals. They argue that our current professions are
               antiquated, opaque and no longer affordable, and that the
               expertise of their best is enjoyed only by a few. In their place,
               they propose five new models for producing and distributing
               expertise in society. The book raises profound policy issues, not
               least about employment (they envisage a new generation of
               'open-collared workers') and about control over online expertise
               (they warn of new 'gatekeepers') - in an era when machines become
               more capable than human beings at most tasks. With a new preface
               exploring recent critical developments, this updated edition
               builds on the authors' groundbreaking research into more than a
               dozen professions. Illustrated with numerous examples from each,
               this is the first book to assess and question the relevance of
               the professions in the 21st century.",

  abstract  = "The literature on social science methods and the issues
               surrounding them has grown massively and continues to increase.
               Yet many social scientists are ambivalent about methodology. For
               some, it plays a central, perhaps even an all-encompassing, role;
               while, for others, it is desirable only in small amounts, or
               indeed is regarded as an irrelevance, as a distraction from
               actually doing research. In this book, Hammersley argues that, in
               large part, this reflects and is part of a wider problem: the
               gradual decline of a previously influential academic model of
               inquiry. This has occurred as a result of ideological challenges
               and the erosion of the institutional conditions that support
               academic work. He defends this model, spelling out the demands it
               places upon social scientists, and examining such issues as the
               proper role of methodology, the nature of objectivity, the false
               idea that social scientists should be intellectuals or social
               critics, the dialectic of academic discussion, the ethics of
               belief, and the limits of academic freedom. More broadly, he also
               questions the role of the social research within society and what
               it means to be a social scientist in the 21st century.
               Hammersley′s book is engagingly written and controversial. It
               tackles the major issues of contemporary social research

               debates about improving economic performance, prosperity and
               well-being. This book is about the learning that goes on in
               workplaces – ranging from offices, factories and shops to gyms,
               health centres and universities – and how it can be improved.
               Such learning includes everyday work activity, on-the-job

               the particularities of work tasks with the way jobs are organized

               virtual reality (VR), the experience will always fail. The VR
               Book bridges this gap by focusing on human-centered design.
               Creating compelling VR applications is an incredibly complex
               challenge. When done well, these experiences can be brilliant and
               pleasurable, but when done badly, they can result in frustration
               and sickness. Whereas limitations of technology can cause bad VR
               execution, problems are oftentimes caused by a lack of
               understanding human perception, interaction, design principles,
               and real users. This book focuses on the human elements of VR,
               such as how users perceive and intuitively interact with various
               forms of reality, causes of VR sickness, creating useful and
               pleasing content, and how to design and iterate upon effective VR
               applications. This book is not just for VR designers, it is for
               managers, programmers, artists, psychologists, engineers,
               students, educators, and user experience professionals. It is for
               the entire VR team, as everyone contributing should understand at
               least the basics of the many aspects of VR design. The industry
               is rapidly evolving, and The VR Book stresses the importance of
               building prototypes, gathering feedback, and using adjustable
               processes to efficiently iterate towards success. It contains

               well-designed products-and for the innovators aspiring to make
               them.It seems like magic when some new gadget seems to know what
               we want before we know ourselves. But why does some design feel
               intrinsically good, and why do some designs last forever, while
               others disappear? User Friendly guides readers through the hidden
               rules governing how design shapes our behaviour, told through
               fascinating stories such as what the nuclear accident at Three
               Mile Island reveals about the logic of the smartphone; how the
               pressures of the Great Depression and World War II created our
               faith in social progress through better product design; and how a
               failed vision for Disney World yielded a new paradigm for

  abstract  = "Informal Learning, Practitioner Inquiry and Occupational
               Education explores how practitioners in a variety of occupations
               perform their jobs and argues that working and learning are
               intricately connected. Drawing on theories around working and
               learning in informal, formal and lifelong settings, the book
               gives insights into how workers negotiate their occupational
               practices. The book investigates four related concepts – informal
               learning, practitioner inquiry, occupational education and
               epistemological perspectives. The combinations of theories and
               empirical case studies are used to provide a conceptual framework
               of inquiry where knowledge, abilities, experiences and skill sets
               play a significant aspect. It presents 11 case studies of
               professions ranging from conventional occupations of acting,
               detective work, international road transportation to emerging
               professions of boardroom consultancy, nutritional therapy and
               opinion leadership. This book will be of great interest for

               the study of informal education, vocational education and
               occupation-related programmes. It will also offer significant

               as its key purposes, objects, formation and practices. In short,
               it seeks to outline and elaborate the nature of the project of
               vocational education. It addresses a significant gap in the
               available literature by providing a single text that elaborates
               the scope and diversity of the sector, its key objectives (i.e.
               vocations and occupations), its formation and development as an
               education sector, and the scope of its purposes and
               considerations in the curriculum. The volume achieves these
               objectives by discussing and defining the concept of vocational
               education as being that form of education that seeks to advise
               individuals about, prepare them for, and further develop their
               capacities to perform the kinds of occupations that societies
               require and individuals need to participate in—and through which
               they often come to define themselves. In particular, it discusses
               the distinctions between occupations as a largely social fact and
               vocations as being a socially shaped outcome assented to by
               individuals. As people identify closely with the kinds of
               occupations they engage in, the standing of, and the
               effectiveness of vocational education is central to individuals’
               well-being, competence and progress. Ultimately, this book argues
               that the provision of vocational education needs to realise
               important personal and social goals.",

               and the Nobel Peace Prize, and honorary degrees from Harvard,
               Cambridge, Oxford and more than fifty other universities, and
               elected not only to the National Academy of Sciences and the
               American Academy of Arts and Letters but the Royal Society and
               the British Academy; a public servant, who served as Chair of
               President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisors and Chief
               Economist and Senior Vice President of the World Bank, headed
               international commissions for the UN and France, and was awarded
               the French Legion of Honor and Australia's Sydney Peace Prize; a
               public intellectual whose numerous books on vital topics have
               been best sellers. What brought him to economics were his
               concerns about the inequality and discrimination he saw growing
               up. Wanting to understand what drives it and what can be done
               about it has been his lifelong passion. This book gathers
               together and extends to new frontiers this lifelong work, drawing
               upon the challenges and insights of each of these phases of his
               career. In a still very widely cited paper written fifty years
               ago, Stiglitz set forth the fundamental framework for analyzing
               intergenerational transfer of wealth and advantage, which plays a
               central role in persistent inequality. That and subsequent work,
               developed most fully here for the first time, described today's
               inequality as a result of centrifugal forces increasing
               inequality and centripetal forces reducing it. In recent decades,
               the centrifugal forces have strengthened, the centripetal forces
               weakened. His general theory provides a framework for
               understanding the marked growth in inequality in recent decades,
               and for devising policies to reduce it. A central message is that
               ever-increasing inequality is not inevitable. Inequality is, in a
               fundamental sense, a choice. Stiglitz explains that inequality
               does not largely arise from differences in savings rates between
               capitalists and others, though that may play a role (as Piketty,
               Marx, and Kaldor suggest); but rather, it originates importantly
               from the rules of the game, which have weakened the bargaining
               power of workers as they have increased the market power of
               corporations. He also explains how monetary authorities have
               contributed to increasing wealth inequality, and how, unless
               something is done about it, likely changes in technology such as
               AI and robotization will make matters worse. He describes
               policies that can simultaneously reduce inequality and improve
               economic performance.",

               the way individuals justify their actions to others,
               instinctively drawing on their experience to appeal to principles
               they hope will command respect. Individuals, however, often
               misread situations, and many disagreements can be explained by
               people appealing, knowingly and unknowingly, to different
               principles. On Justification is the first English translation of
               Luc Boltanski and Laurent Thévenot's ambitious theoretical
               examination of these phenomena, a book that has already had a
               huge impact on French sociology and is likely to have a similar
               influence in the English-speaking world. In this foundational
               work of post-Bourdieu sociology, the authors examine a wide range
               of situations where people justify their actions. The authors
               argue that justifications fall into six main logics exemplified
               by six authors: civic (Rousseau), market (Adam Smith), industrial
               (Saint-Simon), domestic (Bossuet), inspiration (Augustine), and
               fame (Hobbes). The authors show how these justifications
               conflict, as people compete to legitimize their views of a
               situation.On Justification is likely to spark important debates

               answer, according to Taleb, is that humans are hardwired to learn
               specifics when they should be focused on generalities. We
               concentrate on things we already know and time and time again

               strategies that have helped her survive, even thrive, in a world
               not built for her brain. “The world of ADHD has been waiting for
               this book with bated breath for many years. If there’s a fairy

               harder.” When your brain works differently, you need to try
               different. Diagnosed with ADHD at age twelve, Jessica struggled
               with a brain that she didn’t understand. She lost things
               constantly, couldn’t finish projects, and felt like she was
               putting more effort in than everyone around her while falling
               further and further behind. At thirty-two years old—broke,
               divorced, and living with her mom—Jessica decided to look more
               deeply into her ADHD challenges. She reached out to experts,
               devoured articles, and shared her discoveries on YouTube. In How
               to ADHD, Jessica reveals the tools that have changed her life
               while offering an unflinching look at the realities of living
               with ADHD. The key to navigating a world not built for the
               neurodivergent brain, she discovered, isn’t to fix or fight
               against its natural tendencies but to understand and work with
               them. She explains how ADHD affects everyday life, covering
               executive function impairments, rejection sensitivity,
               difficulties with attention regulation, and more. You’ll also
               find ADHD-specific strategies for adapting your environment,
               routines, and systems, including: • Boost the signal and decrease
               the noise. Facilitate focus by putting your goals where you can
               see them and fighting distractions with distractions. • Have less
               stuff to manage. Learn why you have trouble planning and
               prioritizing, and why doing more starts with doing less. • Build
               your “time wisdom.” Work backward when you plan, and track how
               long it actually takes you to do something. • Learn about your
               emotions. Understand how naming your emotions and letting
               yourself experience them can make them easier to regulate. With
               quotes from Jessica’s online community, chapter summaries, and
               reading shortcuts designed for the neurodivergent reader, How to
               ADHD will help you recognize your strengths and challenges,

               Science",
  author    = "Hager, Paul and Beckett, David",
  publisher = "Springer Nature",
  abstract  = "This book centres on a broadened view of complexity that will
               enrich engagement with complexity in the social sciences. The key
               idea is to employ complexity theory to develop a holistic account
               of practice, agency and expertise. In doing so, the book
               acknowledges and builds upon the relational character of
               reductive accounts. It draws upon recent theoretical work on
               complexity, emergence and relationality to develop a novel
               account of practice, agency and expertise in and for workplaces.
               Biological, psychological and social aspects of these are
               integrated. This novel account overcomes problems in current
               views of practice, agency and expertise, which suffer from
               reductive, or fragmented, analyses, based upon individuals,
               groups, or networks. In retrieving the experiential richness of
               human activity – often esteemed as the basis of generative and
               creative life – this book shows how complexity both emerges from,
               and is, a non-reductive feature of, human experience, especially
               in daily work.“...an ambitiously wide-ranging volume, questioning
               the key tenets of respected approaches ..... and offering .....
               ‘novel accounts’, which draw on features of complexity
               thinking.... ...But they go further than any of us in their
               argument that: ‘whatever reductive moves are made, they ‘flow’
               from holistic accounts of relationality which have already
               affectively engaged the purposes of a co-present group.’ This is
               the intellectual contribution that is built consistently and
               persuasively across the chapters.” Professor Emerita Anne
               Edwards, Oxford University``Hager and Beckett have written a book
               that will challenge more commonly held notions of agency,
               practice, skills, and learning. Centering their argument on
               complexity theory or, as they prefer, complexity thinking, Hager
               and Beckett argue that it is through relations that we raise
               questions about, gather data from, and make working sense of the
               complexity that surrounds us. Groups then, particularly small
               groups, hold and implement agentive power. And what the authors
               call co-present groups—ones in which holistic relationality
               occurs socially, and affectively in distinctive places—“draw us
               closer to each other, and harness our normativity by enabling
               negotiability and reason-giving.” If your field of study involves
               anything remotely sociocultural in nature or if you are just
               interested in the complex ways we engage as humans with our
               worlds, you should find a place for this book in your

               researchers who study the transformation of practice through the
               enhancement and transformation of expertise. This is an important
               moment for such a contribution because expertise is in transition
               - moving toward collaboration in inter-organizational fields and
               continuous shaping of transformations. To understand and master
               this transition, powerful new conceptual tools are needed and are
               provided here. The theoretical framework which has shaped these
               studies is Cultural Historical Activity Theory (CHAT). CHAT
               analyses how people and organisations learn to do something new,
               and how both individuals and organisations change. The
               theoretical and methodological tools used have their origins in
               the work of Lev Vygotsky and A.N. Leont’ev. In recent years this
               body of work has aroused significant interest across the social
               sciences, management and communication studies. Working as part
               of an integrated international team, the authors identify
               specific findings which are of direct interest to the academic
               community, such as: the analysis of vertical learning between
               operational and strategic levels within complex organizations;
               the refinement of notions of identity and subject position within
               CHAT; the introduction of the concept of ‘labour power’ into
               CHAT; the development of a method of analysing discourse which
               theoretically coheres with CHAT and the design of projects.
               Activity Theory in Practice will be highly useful to
               practitioners, researchers, students and policy-makers who are

               change—have received very different treatments in the educational
               literature, an oversight directly confronted here. While learning
               and change have been extensively theorised, their various
               contexts articulated and analysed, practice is notably
               underrepresented. Where much of the literature on learning and
               change takes the notion of ‘practice’ as an unexamined given, its
               co-location as a term with various classifiers, as in ‘legal
               practice’ and ‘teaching practice’, render it curiously devoid of
               semantic force.In this book, ‘practice’ is the super-ordinate
               organising idea. Drawing on what has been termed the ‘practice
               turn in contemporary theory’, the work develops a conceptual
               framework for researching learning in, and on, practice. It
               challenges received notions of practice, questioning the
               assumptions, elisions, conflations and silences on the subject.
               In so doing, it offers fresh insights into learning and change,
               and how they relate to practice. In tandem with this conceptual
               work, the book details site-ontological studies of practice and
               learning in diverse professional and workplace contexts,
               examining the work of occupations as various as doctors, chefs
               and orchestral musicians. It demonstrates the value of theorising
               practice, learning and change, as well as exploring the
               connections between them amid our evolving social and
               institutional structures.",

               architecture has been shaped in every era by our access to

               influenced by the energy available to its architects, and why

               construction and running of buildings. If we are to avoid
